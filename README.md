# Unsupervised ML - Netflix Movies and TV Shows Clustering

Problem Statement : 
Netflix, a leading streaming service, has experienced significant changes in its content landscape over the years, with a notable increase in TV shows and a decrease in the number of movies. The challenge is to explore and analyze a dataset containing information on Netflix movies and TV shows as of 2019, sourced from Flixable. The primary goal is to derive meaningful insights into content distribution across countries, discern any shifts in focus from movies to TV shows, and cluster similar content based on text features.

Project Summary :
The primary goal of this project is to conduct an exploratory analysis and clustering analysis on a dataset of Netflix movies and TV shows, aiming to gain insights into content distribution, trends over the years, and clustering of similar content based on text features.

This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

For the given Dataset we have to

* Imported Libraries
* Loaded Dataset
* EDA and Data Vizualization
* Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
* Making some Hypothesis From Data Visulaized
* Pick Appropriate Model and train
* Prediction and some evaluate matrices for model
* Conculsion
